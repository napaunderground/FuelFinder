# FuelFinder
FuelFinder is an Android mobile app developed in Java. The concept behind FuelFinder is simple: find the CHEAPEST gas around you, based on your proximity to stations, your fuel mileage, the cost of fuel at said station, and how much you will spend in gas getting to a station.

FuelFinder uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate which station has the best prices for fuel, and will display the top 4 cheapest stations around you based on your proximity. It will then display routing information to these stations using Google Maps.
